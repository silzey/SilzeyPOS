# Public Directory

This directory is for static assets that will be served from the root of your application.

For example:
- `/public/my-image.png` can be accessed at `/my-image.png`
- `/public/robots.txt` can be accessed at `/robots.txt`

Refer to the Next.js documentation for more details on the public directory.
